/*
Department of Information Technology has a student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of the
Second, third and final year of the department can be granted membership on request. Similarly,
one may cancel the membership of the club. The first node is reserved for the president of the club
and the last node is reserved for the secretary of the club. Write C program to maintain club
memberâ€Ÿs information using a singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to
a) Add and delete the members as well as the president or even secretary.
b) Compute the total number of members of the club
c) Display members of the club
d) Display list in reverse order using recursion
